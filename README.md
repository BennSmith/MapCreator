# MapCreator
An simple isometric map creator built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and p5js.

# About
This project was created as a side project during my second year of college.  In one of my courses, we were using the p5js library (found here: https://p5js.org/), and I wanted to play around with it more, as well as trying my hand at isometric displays.  So, I developed a program which allows the user to create a rudimentary isometric map in a 20x20 grid.

To use the program, first go to https://bennsmith.github.io/MapCreator/.  One the left hand side you will see places to input x and y coordinates.  The x coordinates range from 0 to 19 starting at the left corner and going to the top.  The y coordinates range from 0 to 19 starting at the left corner and going to the bottom.  One coordinates have been entered, pressing one of the tile options below will create that tile at the entered coordinates.
